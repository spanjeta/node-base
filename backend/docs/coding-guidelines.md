# NodeJS Coding Style Guidelines

# Formatting

- Indentation : 
   * Use four spaces.

- Newlines :
   * Use UNIX - style newlines(\n), and a newline character as the last character of a file.Windows - style newlines(\r\ n) are forbidden inside any repository.

- No trailing white space :
   * Clean up any trailing white space in your JS files.

- Use semicolons :  
   * Usage of semicolons is a core value.

- 80 characters per line :
   * Limit your lines to 80 characters.

- single quotes :
   * Use single quotes, unless you are writing JSON.This helps you separate your objects’ strings from normal strings. Example: var fruit = ‘mango’
      
- Opening braces :
   * Opening braces should be on the same line

# Varibale Declaration :
   * Declare one variable per var statement 
   * make use of let var and const as required

# Naming Conventions
   - Use lowerCamelCase for variables, properties and function names : Variables, properties and function names should use lowerCamelCase.They should also be descriptive.Single character variables and uncommon abbreviations should generally be avoided.
   - Use UpperCamelCase for class names : Class names should be capitalized using UpperCamelCase. example:  BankAccount

   - Use UPPERCASE for Constants : Constants should be declared as regular variables or static class properties, using all uppercase letters
	   
# Variables
   - Object / Array creation : Always quote only keys  in arrays and objects

# Conditionals 
   - Use the === operator 
   - Use descriptive conditions : Any non - trivial conditions should be assigned to a descriptively named variable or function

# Functions
   * Write small functions : Keep your functions short.
   *  Return early from functions : To avoid deep nesting of if - statements, always return a function’ s value as early as possible.
    	
   - Method chaining : One method per line should be used. Example: 

# Comments
   * Use slashes for comments
     Use slashes
	 for both single line and multi line comments.

# Error handling
   * Operational errors
   * Programmer errors  
  
# Miscellaneous
   * Requires at top : Always put requires at top of file to clearly illustrate a file’ s dependencies.
